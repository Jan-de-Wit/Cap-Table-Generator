# Additional Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented three major enhancements to the Cap Table Generator system:

1. **Updated System Prompt** for LLM service with valuation-based calculation features
2. **Compound Interest Support** with simple/compound flag and Excel formulas
3. **Tool Call Batching** with intelligent dependency analysis

Implementation Date: October 26, 2024

---

## 1. LLM System Prompt Updates ✅

### Changes Made

Updated the system prompt in `webapp/backend/services/llm_service.py` to teach the AI agent about:

- **Valuation-based calculations**: How to use `investment_amount` + `valuation_basis` instead of `initial_quantity`
- **Interest fields**: `interest_rate`, `interest_start_date`, and `interest_type`
- **New validation rules**: Instruments must have EITHER shares OR investment data
- **Workflow updates**: Create rounds with valuation data first, then instruments

### New Example Tool Calls Added

1. **Round for valuation-based instruments**:
```json
{
  "operation": "append",
  "path": "/rounds",
  "value": {
    "name": "Series B",
    "round_date": "2024-12-01",
    "post_money_valuation": 50000000,
    "pre_round_shares": 25000000
  }
}
```

2. **Valuation-based instrument**:
```json
{
  "operation": "append",
  "path": "/instruments",
  "value": {
    "holder_name": "Acme Ventures",
    "class_name": "Series B Preferred",
    "round_name": "Series B",
    "investment_amount": 5000000,
    "valuation_basis": "post_money",
    "acquisition_date": "2024-12-01"
  }
}
```

3. **Instrument with interest**:
```json
{
  "operation": "append",
  "path": "/instruments",
  "value": {
    "holder_name": "Bridge Investor",
    "class_name": "Convertible Note",
    "round_name": "Bridge Round",
    "investment_amount": 500000,
    "valuation_basis": "pre_money",
    "interest_rate": 0.08,
    "interest_start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "interest_type": "simple",
    "acquisition_date": "2024-01-01"
  }
}
```

### Question Templates

Added guidance for the AI to ask:
- What is the investment amount?
- Is this based on pre-money or post-money valuation?
- What is the valuation amount?
- How many shares were outstanding before this round?
- Is there interest? If yes, what rate, start date, and type (simple/compound)?

---

## 2. Compound Interest Support ✅

### Schema Updates

Added `interest_type` field to schemas:

**Files Modified**:
- `cap_table_schema.json` (2 locations: Instrument and ConvertibleTerms)
- `src/captable/schema.py` (2 locations)
- `webapp/frontend/src/types/captable.types.ts`

**Field Specification**:
```json
{
  "interest_type": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["simple", "compound"],
    "default": "simple",
    "description": "Type of interest calculation (simple or compound annually)"
  }
}
```

### Formula Implementation

Updated `src/captable/formulas.py`:

```python
def create_accrued_interest_formula(
    self, 
    principal_ref: str, 
    interest_rate_ref: str,
    start_date_ref: str, 
    end_date_ref: str = "Current_Date",
    interest_type: str = "simple"
) -> str:
    """Create interest accrual formula (simple or compound)."""
```

### Excel Formulas Generated

**Simple Interest** (default):
```excel
=IFERROR(Principal * Rate * (DAYS(EndDate, StartDate) / 365), 0)
```

**Compound Interest**:
```excel
=IFERROR(Principal * (POWER((1 + Rate), (DAYS(EndDate, StartDate) / 365)) - 1), 0)
```

### Mathematical Formulas

**Simple Interest**:
```
Interest = Principal × Rate × (Days / 365)
```

**Compound Interest**:
```
Interest = Principal × ((1 + Rate)^(Days/365) - 1)
```

Where the exponent represents fractional years for continuous compounding.

### Usage Example

```json
{
  "holder_name": "Investor",
  "class_name": "Convertible Note",
  "round_name": "Bridge",
  "investment_amount": 500000,
  "valuation_basis": "pre_money",
  "interest_rate": 0.10,
  "interest_start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "interest_type": "compound",
  "acquisition_date": "2024-01-01"
}
```

With 10% compound interest over 1 year:
- Simple: $500,000 × 0.10 × 1 = $50,000
- Compound: $500,000 × ((1.10)^1 - 1) = $50,000

Over 2 years:
- Simple: $500,000 × 0.10 × 2 = $100,000
- Compound: $500,000 × ((1.10)^2 - 1) = $105,000

---

## 3. Tool Call Batching ✅

### Implementation

Added intelligent dependency analysis to batch tool calls in `webapp/backend/services/llm_service.py`:

**New Methods**:
1. `_analyze_tool_dependencies()` - Analyzes dependencies between tool calls
2. `_has_dependency()` - Checks if one call depends on another

### Dependency Detection

The system detects these dependency patterns:

1. **Instrument → Holder**: Instrument creating needs its holder to exist first
2. **Instrument → Class**: Instrument creating needs its class to exist first
3. **Instrument → Round**: Instrument creating needs its round to exist first
4. **Class → Terms**: Preferred class needs its terms package to exist first

### Batching Algorithm

1. Parse all tool calls to extract operation details
2. Build dependency graph between calls
3. Use topological grouping to create batches
4. Execute batches sequentially, calls within batch can be parallel

### Example Batching

**Tool Calls**:
1. Create holder "Alice"
2. Create holder "Bob"
3. Create terms "Series A Terms"
4. Create class "Series A" (depends on terms)
5. Create round "Series A"
6. Create instrument for Bob in Series A round (depends on 2, 4, 5)

**Batched Execution**:
- **Batch 1**: Calls 1, 2, 3, 5 (all independent)
- **Batch 2**: Call 4 (depends on terms from batch 1)
- **Batch 3**: Call 6 (depends on holder, class, round from previous batches)

### Events Emitted

New streaming events for batching:
```json
{"event": "tool_calls_start", "data": {"count": 6, "batches": 3}}
{"event": "batch_start", "data": {"batch_index": 0, "batch_size": 4}}
{"event": "batch_complete", "data": {"batch_index": 0}}
```

### Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Latency**: Independent operations can be optimized
- **Better Error Handling**: Dependency failures prevent subsequent calls
- **Clearer Logging**: Shows execution strategy
- **Future Parallelization**: Architecture ready for async execution within batches

## Testing Results

### Test Suite: `test_compound_interest_and_batching.py`

#### Test 1: Formula Generation ✅
```
✓ Simple interest formula: =IFERROR(A1 * B1 * (DAYS(D1, C1) / 365), 0)
✓ Compound interest formula: =IFERROR(A1 * (POWER((1 + B1), (DAYS(D1, C1) / 365)) - 1), 0)
```

#### Test 2: Full Example with Compound Interest ✅
```
✓ Validation passed with compound interest

## Integration with Previous Features

These features build on the valuation-based calculations implemented earlier:

### Combined Feature Example

```json
{
  "instruments": [{
    "holder_name": "Strategic Investor",
    "class_name": "Convertible Note",
    "round_name": "Bridge Round",
    "investment_amount": 1000000,
    "valuation_basis": "pre_money",
    "interest_rate": 0.12,
    "interest_start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "interest_type": "compound",
    "acquisition_date": "2024-01-01"
  }],
  "rounds": [{
    "name": "Bridge Round",
    "round_date": "2024-01-01",
    "pre_money_valuation": 15000000,
    "pre_round_shares": 12000000
  }]
}
```

This instrument will:
1. Calculate shares based on pre-money valuation ($15M)
2. Include compound interest at 12% annually
3. Be properly batched when created via LLM tool calls
4. Generate dynamic Excel formulas that update automatically

---

## Usage Guidelines

### For Simple Interest (Default)
- Use for straightforward convertible notes
- Standard practice for most startup financing
- Example: "$500K at 8% simple interest"

### For Compound Interest
- Use for longer-term convertible instruments
- More accurate for multi-year investments
- Specify `"interest_type": "compound"` explicitly
- Example: "$500K at 10% compound interest annually"

### For Tool Call Batching
- Automatic - no user action required
- LLM service handles dependency analysis
- Monitor logs for batching efficiency
- Events available for UI feedback

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Interest Calculation
1. **Multiple Compounding Periods**: Support quarterly, monthly compounding
2. **Variable Interest Rates**: Allow rate changes over time
3. **Accrual Methods**: Different day-count conventions (30/360, Actual/Actual)

### Tool Call Batching
4. **True Parallel Execution**: Use async/await for independent calls
5. **Smart Reordering**: Optimize batch order for fastest execution
6. **Caching**: Cache validation results across batched calls

### Not Required for Current Release
These would be valuable but the current implementation fully satisfies requirements.
