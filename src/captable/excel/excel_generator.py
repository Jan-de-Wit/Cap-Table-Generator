Excel Generator

Creates Excel workbooks from cap table JSON data using xlsxwriter.
Implements standardized sheet structure with Named Ranges, Excel Tables, and formulas.

This module has been refactored to use modular sheet generators for maintainability.
The main ExcelGenerator class orchestrates generation by calling specialized generators.

ARCHITECTURE - ROUND-BASED DESIGN:

The Excel workbook centers around the ROUNDS sheet as the source of truth, with each
round containing nested instruments. The Cap Table Progression provides a summary view.

Data Flow:
1. Rounds Sheet (Source of Truth)
   - Each round displayed vertically with constants and nested instruments
   - Formulas calculate share quantities based on round's calculation_type
   - Different column sets for: fixed_shares, target_percentage, valuation_based, convertible

2. Cap Table Progression (Summary View)
   - Shows ownership evolution across rounds
   - References instrument shares from Rounds sheet
   - Chains rounds: Round 1 Total → Round 2 Start → Round 2 Total, etc.

All calculations are transparent and fully traceable through Excel formulas.
No hardcoded share amounts - everything derives from source data.
